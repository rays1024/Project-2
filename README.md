# DATA 410 Advanced Applied Machine Learning Project 2
In this project, we will compare the following regularization techniques in terms of variable selection and prediction. We will applly the following techniques on both real data and synthetic data.

## Simulated Data

## Ridge Regularization


## Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)


## Elastic Net


## Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation (SCAD)


## Square Root LASSO
